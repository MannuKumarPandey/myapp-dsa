1) When we need all possible permutations of the given input, so it does not mean that which ever
index we have accessed, is the left boundry index.
we still need to traverse frm 0 till last index .
use for loop with 0 to len -1 as driver call and then do recursive.(Iteration along with recursion)
but we can also use only recursion calls as well, just we need to take care of the recursive Driver call.


2) When we need all possible subsets/subsequences of the given input,
So it is not required to traverse back from the index which we have reached so far.
In that case ,
better approach will be
a) call recursion with including the input
b) remove the included part
c) again do the recursive call.
